"<span id="k">Hey there, nice to see you here.</span>"

This is Devdatta Khoche.<p>Welcome!!</p>
<p>I am a third year engineering student at VESIT studying Information technology.I have a passion for learning and developing new skills related to programming.
First and Foremost I love Coding.I just entered the community and I was amused to see tons of people working and making great things, this inspired me to work and code for the betterment of the community as well as the society and I am definitely enjoying it.

Ever since writing my first program in C, I have never have had a feeling of getting bored, the only thing I have is the curiosity for something more.
